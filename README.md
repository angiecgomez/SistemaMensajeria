## SistemaMensajeria

This is an example application following the Publisher - Subscriber pattern and the Microkernel architecture. It also makes use of the RabbitMq server that provides us with a messaging broker and the existence of a queue between sender and receiver.

## Rabbit Install: Homebrew

Execute one command followed by the other.

```
brew update
brew install rabbitmq
```

## Run and stop the RabbitMQ server

```
brew services start rabbitmq
brew services stop rabbitmq
```
